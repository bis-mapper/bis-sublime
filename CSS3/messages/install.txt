Thank you for installing CSS3! It's strongly recommended that you disable the
default CSS package, as its completions will interfere with the improved CSS3
completions.

Mac:           cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
Linux/Windows: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS

If you have CSS3_Syntax or Emmet installed, you should remove those as well.
Removing Emmet breaks my heart, but the code it inserts is often quite outdated,
and it's completions completely drown out the completions in this plugin.

That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
Github and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
